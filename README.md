*«book publishing as easy as it should be»*

**[easybook](http://easybook-project.org)** lets you easily publish books in
various electronic formats (PDF, ePub and HTML). It was originally designed to
publish technical programming books, but you can use **easyboook** to publish
any kind of book, manual or documentation website.

## Installation ##

**easybook** can be installed in three different ways depending upon your needs:

  1. **ZIP** instalation: best suited for users who want to try **easybook** 
     features as fast and easy as possible.
  2. **Composer** installation: recommended for regular users who want to use
     **easybook** for publishing books and documentation.
  3. **Git** installation: reserved for advanced developers who want to hack and
     modify **easybook**.

Regardless the way you install it, use **easybook** with the `book` command:

```
$ cd easybook-installation-dir
$ ./book
```

If the last command doesn't work, try `php book` or check `book` script
permissions.
