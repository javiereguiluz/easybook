// TODO: this is a temporary fix.
// When executing the test suite with a locale different from en_US, some tests
// fail. My console set es_ES as locale and I got three errors because the
// numeric result of Twig expressions is expressed as 4,8 instead of 4.8
// I've tried setting number format explicitly in Twig with no luck:
// $twig->getExtension('core')->setNumberFormat(0, '.', ',');
setlocale(LC_ALL, 'en_US');
