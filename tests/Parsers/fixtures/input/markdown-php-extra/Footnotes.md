# Header[^fourth]

Some paragraph with a footnote[^1], and another[^2].

[^1]: Content for fifth footnote.
[^2]: Content for sixth footnote spaning on 
    three lines, with some span-level markup like
    _emphasis_, a [link][].

Another paragraph with a named footnote[^fn-name].

[^fn-name]:
    Footnote beginning on the line next to the marker.

This paragraph should not have a footnote marker since 
the footnote is undefined.[^3]

This paragraph should not have a footnote marker since 
the footnote has already been used before.[^1]

This paragraph links to a footnote with plenty of 
block-level content.[^block]

[^block]:
	Paragraph.
	
	*   List item
	
	> Blockquote
	
	    Code block

This paragraph host the footnote reference within a 
footnote test[^reference].

[^reference]:
	This footnote has a footnote of its own.[^nested]

[^nested]:
	This footnote should appear even though as it is refered
	from another footnote. But [^reference] should be litteral
	since the footnote with that name has already been used.
