        <h2 id="creating-your-own-theme">A.1 Creating your own theme</h2>

<p><strong>easybook</strong> themes make your books look beautiful by default. However, your books should define their own styles to fine-tune its appearance. To do this, create a directory called <code>Resources</code> within the directory of the book and inside it, create another directory called <code>Templates</code>.</p>

<p>You can now include your own templates in the <code>Resources/Templates/</code> to apply them to the published book. The name of the template must match the element type (<code>chapter</code>, <code>dedication</code>, <code>author</code>, etc..) and its extension should be <code>.twig</code> because they are always created with the Twig templating language. Consequently, if you want to modify the design of the chapters, you must create a template called <code>chapter.twig</code>.</p>

<p>When you publish a book, <strong>easybook</strong> first looks for the templates in the following directories and in the following order (if none of these templates is found, it will use the default template):</p>

<ol>
<li><code>&lt;book&gt;/Resources/Templates/&lt;edition-name&gt;/template.twig</code>, allows you to modify the design for each edition. The directory inside <code>Templates/</code> must match exacly the name of the edition being published.</li>
<li><code>&lt;book&gt;/Resources/Templates/&lt;edition-type&gt;/template.twig</code>, allows you to modify the design for all the editions of the same type.  permite modificar el aspecto para todas las ediciones del mismo tipo. The directory inside <code>Templates/</code> must be named <code>html</code>, <code>html_chunked</code> or <code>pdf</code>.</li>
<li><code>&lt;book&gt;/Resources/Templates/template.twig</code>, applies the same same design to all editions. The template is located in the <code>Resources/Templates</code> directory without including it in any subdirectory. This option is rarely used because it usually doesn't make sense to apply the same style regardless of whether content is converted into a PDF file or a website.</li>
</ol>

<p>As explained in the previous chapter, the templates have access to a variable named <code>item</code> with all the information about the item that is being decorated and three global variables with information about the book (<code>book</code>), the edition being published (<code>edition</code>) and the entire application (<code>app</code>).</p>

<h3 id="available-templates-per-edition">A.1.1 Available templates per edition</h3>

<p>The following list shows the default templates included in <code>pdf</code> and <code>html</code> type editions (their contents obviously varies from one type to the other):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>acknowledgement.twig</code></li>
<li><code>toc.twig</code></li>
<li><code>appendix.twig</code></li>
<li><code>author.twig</code></li>
<li><code>book.twig</code>, this is the final template that assembles all the book contents.</li>
<li><code>chapter.twig</code></li>
<li><code>cover.twig</code></li>
<li><code>dedication.twig</code></li>
<li><code>edition.twig</code></li>
<li><code>license.twig</code></li>
<li><code>part.twig</code></li>
<li><code>title.twig</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>html_chunked</code> edition type doesn't include a different template for each content type. It onle defines the following three templates:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>index.twig</code>, the template that generates the front page of the website. By default it includes the following contents: <code>cover</code>, <code>toc</code>, <code>edition</code> and <code>license</code>.</li>
<li><code>chunk.twig</code>, generic template applied to all the rest of the content types. This template must only include the contents of the item being decorated. The common features of the website are defined in the <code>layout.twig</code> template.</li>
<li><code>layout.twig</code>, generic template applied to all the content types, including the front page, after decorating them with their own templates. This is the best template to include the common features of the website, such as header, footer and links to CSS and JavaScript files.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="stylesheets">A.1.2 Stylesheets</h3>

<p>In addition to Twig templates, themes include a custom CSS stylesheet for each edition type. These default styles are applied whenever the <code>include_styles</code> option of the edition is <code>true</code>. If you don't want to apply these styles, delete the option or give it a <code>false</code> value.</p>

<p>However, the most common scenario is to maintain the default <strong>easybook</strong> styles and then apply your custom CSS to include new styles or modify them. To do this, add a file called <code>styles.css</code> within the directory:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>&lt;book&gt;/Resources/Templates/&lt;edition-name&gt;/styles.css</code>, if you want to apply the styles just to one specific edition.</li>
<li><code>&lt;book&gt;/Resources/Templates/&lt;edtion-type&gt;/styles.css</code>, if you want to apply the same styles to all the editions of the same type (<code>html</code>, <code>html_chunked</code> or <code>pdf</code>).</li>
<li><code>&lt;book&gt;/Resources/Templates/styles.css</code>,  if you want to apply the same styles to all the editions of the book.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="plugins">A.2 Plugins</h2>

<p>Despite being a simple application, <strong>easybook</strong> easily adapts to your requirements. The previous chapters showed lots of examples of this flexibility, but the <strong>plugins</strong> explained in this section are by far the more powerful example.</p>

<p>A plugin allows you to completely modify the behavior of <strong>easybook</strong>. Imagine you want to modify the original Markdown content of the chapters  before converting it to HTML. This is really easy because, before converting a content, <strong>easybook</strong> notifies that it's going to convert it. Then, your book can create a plugin that <em>listens</em> to this events and executes some code when an specific event is notified.</p>

<p>Technically, plugins are based on the subscribers defined by the event dispatcher component of Symfony2. They are regular PHP classes whose name always ends with the word <code>Plugin</code>. The following code shows the source of <code>TimerPlugin.php</code>, the plugin used by <strong>easybook</strong> to measure how long it takes to publish a book:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">&lt;?php
namespace Easybook\Plugins;
&nbsp;
use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface;
use Easybook\Events\EasybookEvents as Events;
use Easybook\Events\BaseEvent;
&nbsp;
class TimerPlugin implements EventSubscriberInterface
{
    static public function getSubscribedEvents()
    {
        return array(
            Events::PRE_PUBLISH  =&gt; 'onStart',
            Events::POST_PUBLISH =&gt; 'onFinish',
        );
    }
&nbsp;
    public function onStart(BaseEvent $event)
    {
        $event-&gt;app-&gt;set('app.timer.start', microtime(true));
    }
&nbsp;
    public function onFinish(BaseEvent $event)
    {
        $event-&gt;app-&gt;set('app.timer.finish', microtime(true));
    }
}</pre>
</div>

<p><strong>easybook</strong> plugins must implement <code>EventSubscriberInterface</code> interface, which in turn forces to define a method called <code>getSubscribedEvents()</code>. This method simply returns an array of events that you want to subscribe to and the name of the methods that are executed when those events occur.</p>

<p><strong>easybook</strong> currently has six events, defined in <code>Easybook\Events\EasybookEvents</code> class:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Events::PRE_PUBLISH</code>, notified before starting the publication of the book but after setting the value of all the <code>publishing.*</code> internal variables.</li>
<li><code>Events::POST_PUBLISH</code>, notified after finishing the publication of the book but before showing the success/failure messages to the user.</li>
<li><code>Events::PRE_PARSE</code>, notified before starting the conversion of the original element content (usually written in Markdown format).</li>
<li><code>Events::POST_PARSE</code>, notified after the original content has been fully converted (usually this converted content is HTML).</li>
<li><code>Events::PRE_NEW</code>, notified before starting the creation of the new book, just before starting the file an directory structure creation.</li>
<li><code>Events::POST_NEW</code>, notified just before the structure of the new book has been created, but before showing the success/failure messages to the user.</li>
</ul>

<p>The methods that are executed in response to events receive as first parameter an object whose type depends on the notified event. In general, events receive a <code>BaseEvent</code> object, but the events related to content parsing receive an object of type <code>ParseEvent</code> (which in turn inherits from <code>BaseEvent</code>).</p>

<p>You can access any property and service application through the event object using <code>$event-&gt; app</code>, as shown below:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">// ...
&nbsp;
public function onStart(BaseEvent $event)
{
    $event-&gt;app-&gt;set('app.timer.start', microtime(true));
}</pre>
</div>

<p>If you want to add plugins to your own book, create a directory called <code>Plugins</code> inside the <code>Resources</code> directory of your book (create the latter one if it doesn't exist). Then add as many PHP classes as you want, but make their name always end in <code>Plugin.php</code>. Do not add any namespace to your plugin classes.</p>

<p>The following example shows a plugin that modifies the contents of the book before and after its conversion. First, the plugin modifies the original Markdown content to put in bold all occurrences of the word <em>easybook</em>. Then, it modifies the HTML content to add a <code>class</code> attribute to all these occurrences:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">&lt;?php
use Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventSubscriberInterface;
use Easybook\Events\EasybookEvents as Events;
use Easybook\Events\ParseEvent;
&nbsp;
class BrandingPlugin implements EventSubscriberInterface
{
    static public function getSubscribedEvents()
    {
        return array(
            Events::PRE_PARSE  =&gt; 'onItemPreParse',
            Events::POST_PARSE =&gt; 'onItemPostParse',
        );
    }
&nbsp;
    public function onItemPreParse(ParseEvent $event)
    {
        $txt = str_replace(
            'easybook',
            '**easybook**',
            $event-&gt;getOriginal()
        );
&nbsp;
        $event-&gt;setOriginal($txt);
    }
&nbsp;
    public function onItemPostParse(ParseEvent $event)
    {
        $html = str_replace(
            '&lt;strong&gt;easybook&lt;/strong&gt;',
            '&lt;strong class=&quot;branding&quot;&gt;easybook&lt;/strong&gt;',
            $event-&gt;getContent()
        );
&nbsp;
        $event-&gt;setContent($html);
    }
}</pre>
</div>

<p>The event object received by plugins related to content parsing is of type <code>ParseEvent</code>. In addition to application access (<code>$event-&gt;app</code>), this object has getters and setters for all the properties of the parsing object.</p>

<p>The event <code>Events::PRE_PARSE</code> is notified before the conversion, so you only have access to the original content (<code>getOriginal()</code>). In contrast, the event <code>Events::POST_PARSE</code> is notified after the conversion, so it doesn't make sense to modify the original content but the converted content (<code>getContent()</code>).</p>

<h2 id="advanced-features">A.3 Advanced features</h2>

<h3 id="different-directories-per-book">A.3.1 Different directories per book</h3>

<p>Unless stated otherwise, the books are created in the <code>doc/</code> directory of <strong>easybook</strong>. If you want to save the contents in any other directory, add the <code>--dir</code> option when creating and/or publishig the book:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">$ ./book new &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; --dir=&quot;/Users/javier/books&quot;
(the book is created in &quot;/Users/javier/books/the-origin-of-species&quot;)
&nbsp;
$ ./book publish the-origin-of-species print --dir=&quot;/Users/javier/books&quot;
(the book is published in &quot;/Users/javier/books/the-origin-of-species/Output/print/book.pdf&quot;)</pre>
</div>

<h3 id="advanced-configuration">A.3.2 Advanced configuration</h3>

<p><strong>easybook</strong> doesn't restrict the configuration options that you can set on your book, editions and contents. <strong>easybook</strong> always puts you in control, so you can define all the new settings that you may need.</p>

<p>Do you want to show the price of the book on the cover? Add a new option called <code>price</code> under the <code>book</code> option of <code>config.yml</code> file:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">book:
    ...
    price: 10</pre>
</div>

<p>Now you can use this option in any template with the following expression: <code>{{ book.price }}</code>.  Do you want to use different CSS frameworks to generate the book website? Add a new option called <code>framework</code> in some editions:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">editions:
    my_website1:
        format:    html_chunked
        framework: twitter_bootstrap
        ...
&nbsp;
    my_website2:
        extends:   my_website1
        framework: 960_gs</pre>
</div>

<p>This new option is now available in any template through the following expression: <code>{{ edition.framework }}</code>. Finally, you can also add new options to the contents of the book.  Do you want to indicate the estimated reading time in each chapter? Add the following <code>time</code> option for <code>chapter</code> elements:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">contents:
    - { element: cover }
    - ...
    - { element: chapter, number: 1, ..., time: 20 }
    - { element: chapter, number: 2, ..., time: 12 }
    - ...</pre>
</div>

<p>And now you can add <code>{{ item.config.time }}</code> in <code>chapter.twig</code> template to show the estimated reading time for each chapter.</p>

<h3 id="defining-new-content-types">A.3.3 Defining new content types</h3>

<p>It's uncommon and generally unneeded, but you can also define new content types besides the elvent types included in <strong>easybook</strong>. Imagine that you want to include a page with a humorous cartoon between some chapters. Let's call this new content type <code>cartoon</code>. First, you should add it to your book contents list:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">contents:
    - { element: cover }
    - ...
    - { element: chapter, number: 1, ... }
    - { element: cartoon, image: cartoon1.png, content: cartoon.md }
    - { element: chapter, number: 2, ... }
    - ...</pre>
</div>

<p>Secondly, create the <code>cartoon.md</code> file in your book <code>Contents/</code> directory. For this new content type it's unnecessary to write content, so leave it empty. <strong>easybook</strong> needs some content for every element of the book. Since <code>cartoon</code> is a custom made type, <strong>easybook</strong> doesn't define a default content for it, so you <strong>must</strong> create the <code>cartoon.md</code> file even if you leve it empty.</p>

<p>Lastly, create the <code>Resources/Templates/</code> directory inside your book directory. Add a new <code>cartoon.twig</code> template and copy the following Twig code:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">&lt;div class=&quot;page:cartoon new-page&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;{{ item.config.image }}&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>That's it! You can now use the new <code>cartoon</code> content type in your book and you can create new content types following the same steps explained above.</p>

<h3 id="easybook-internals">A.3.4 easybook internals</h3>

<p><strong>easybook</strong> flexibility allows you to create advanced books without effort and without having to study the source code of the application. However, to master <strong>easybook</strong> you'll have to dive into the guts of the application.</p>

<p>The core and philosophy of <strong>easybook</strong> share many similarities with the source code of <a href="http://silex.sensiolabs.org/">Silex</a>, a PHP microframework that has also been created with the Symfony components. If you don't know Silex, we recommend that you study it and use it to create a demo application. Then, it'll vey easy for you to understand the source code of <strong>easybook</strong>.</p>

<p>The most important class of <strong>easybook</strong> is <code>src/Easybook/DependencyInjection/Application.php</code>. This class follows the <em>dependency injection</em> pattern, it's created with <a href="http://pimple.sensiolabs.org/">Pimple component</a> and contains all the variables, functions and services of the application.</p>

<p>The most interesting command of <strong>easybook</strong> is <code>publish</code>, which publishes an specific edition of the book. Internally it uses a class of type <em>publisher</em>, which depends on the type of edition that is published (<code>html</code>, <code>html_chunked</code> or <code>pdf</code>). The details of each <em>publisher</em> vary, but its basic operation is always the same:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">public function publishBook()
{
    $this-&gt;loadContents();
    $this-&gt;parseContents();
    $this-&gt;decorateContents();
    $this-&gt;assembleBook();
}</pre>
</div>

<p>First the contents of the book, defined in the <code>contents</code> option of <code>config.yml</code> file, are loaded (<code>loadContents()</code>) . Then, each content is parsed (<code>parseContents()</code>) to convert it from its original format to the format needed by this <em>publisher</em>.</p>

<p>At the moment <strong>easybook</strong> only supports Markdown as original format. If you want to add support for other formats, you have to create a new parser (dig into the Markdown parser to know how to create it) and you also have to change the <code>parseContents()</code> method of the <em>publisher</em>.</p>

<p>After converting all contents to the desired format (usually HTML) they are decorated using Twig templates (<code>decorateContents()</code>). Finally, the <code>assembleBook()</code> method is responsible for creating the published book. This is the most unique method of the <em>publishers</em>, as sometimes it has to create a PDF file, sometimes just an HTML file and other times it must create an entire website with many HTML pages.</p>
