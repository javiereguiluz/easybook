        <p><strong>easybook</strong> is an application that lets you easily publish books in various electronic formats. Originally it was designed to publish technical programming books, but you can use <strong>easyboook</strong> to publish any kind of book, manual or documentation.</p>

<div class="figure" id="figure-1-1">
    <img src="images/placeholder.png" alt="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" />

    <p class="caption"><strong>Figure 1.1</strong> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</p>
</div>


<p>Before using <strong>easybook</strong> check that you have installed and configured PHP 5.3.2 or higher on your computer. If you do not understand the previous sentence, ask advice from a computer savvy friend and send him the link to this page. You can check your installed PHP version executing the following command on the console:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">php -v</pre>
</div>

<p><strong>easybook</strong> is a free and open-source application. This means that you can do anything with it, even profiting from it. Anyway, you must meet the following two conditions:</p>

<ol>
<li>You must always maintain the <code>LICENSE.md</code> file included in the source code. This file explains the license of <strong>easybook</strong> and its original author.</li>
<li>You must publish your work under the very same conditions. This means that other people could use and profit from your derived work.</li>
</ol>

<p>In any case, you are the sole proprietor of the books published with <strong>easybook</strong>, including all the copyright and related rights applicable in your country of residence. You are not obliged to share these works in any way, even if you benefit from them financially.</p>

<h2 id="downloading-easybook">1.1 Downloading easybook</h2>

<p>Before downloading <strong>easybook</strong>, create a directory for it. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>On Windows: <code>C:\Users\javier\projects\easybook</code></li>
<li>On Mac OS X: <code>/Users/javier/projects/easybook</code></li>
<li>On Linux: <code>/home/javier/projects/easybook</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If you have Git installed on your computer, you should download  <strong>easybook</strong> cloning its public repository with the following command (replace <code>&lt;dir&gt;</code> for the path of the directory created previously):</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">$ git clone http://github.com/javiereguiluz/easybook.git &lt;dir&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>If you don't use Git, you can download <strong>easybook</strong> as a compressed <code>.zip</code> archive. It's not as cool as using Git, but it works fine. Download the following file and uncompress it on the previously created directory: <a href="http://github.com/javiereguiluz/easybook/zipball/master">http://github.com/javiereguiluz/easybook/zipball/master</a></p>

<h3 id="using-easybook">1.1.1 Using easybook</h3>

<p>Once downloaded/unzipped, open a command console and run the following PHP script to check that you have downloaded <strong>easybook</strong>  correctly:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">$ ./book</pre>
</div>

<p>If everything is fine, <strong>easybook</strong> should welcome you with the following message:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">                    |              |    
,---.,---.,---.,   .|---.,---.,---.|__/ 
|---',---|`---.|   ||   ||   ||   ||  \ 
`---'`---^`---'`---|`---'`---'`---'`   `
               `---'
&nbsp;
easybook is the easiest and fastest tool to generate
technical documentation, books, manuals and websites.
&nbsp;
Available commands:
  help      Displays help for a command
  list      Lists commands
  new       Creates a new empty book
  publish   Publishes an edition of a book
  version   Shows installed easybook version</pre>
</div>

<p>If you find any issue running <code>./book</code> script, try running it as <code>php book</code>. If you still  find any issues, check the permissions of the <code>book</code> script. If everything fails, ask again advice from your computer savvy friends.</p>

<p>The <code>./book</code> script is the unique <em>entry point</em> for every <strong>easybook</strong> command. If you need to know for example the installed version, just run the <code>version</code> command through <code>book</code> script:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">$ ./book version
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
                    |              |

<h2 id="creating-the-book">1.2 Creating the book</h2>

<p>In this section you will create your first <strong>easybook</strong> demo book. However, if you want to try <strong>easybook</strong> features as quickly as possible, you can use ready-made demo books named <code>easybook-doc-en</code> (English <strong>easybook</strong> documentation) and <code>easybook-doc-es</code> (Spanish <strong>easybook</strong> documentation). In that case, you can skip to the <em>Publishing the book</em> section.</p>

<p><strong>easybook</strong> requires that your books follow a certain structure of archives and directories. To avoid creating this structure by hand, new books are bootstrapped with <strong>easybook</strong> <code>new</code> command:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">$ ./book new &quot;The Origin of Species&quot;</pre>
</div>

<p>Type the title of your book after <code>new</code> command enclosing it with quotes. The result of this command is a new <code>the-origin-of-species</code> directory inside <strong>easybook</strong> <code>doc/</code> directory. Inside the new directory, you should see the following structure:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">&lt;easybook&gt;/
    doc/
        the-origin-of-species/
            config.yml
            Contents/
                chapter1.md
                chapter2.md
                images/
            Output/</pre>
</div>

<p>These are the archives and directories created by <strong>easybook</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>config.yml</code>, this archive contains all the book configuration options. We'll cover all of them in the next sections and chapters, but meanwhile you can change the <code>author</code> option to set the book author's name (for example, <code>Charles Darwin</code>).</li>
<li><code>Contents/</code>, this directory holds all the book contents (both text and images). <strong>easybook</strong> creates two sample chapters (<code>chapter1.md</code> and <code>chapter2.md</code>) and an empty <code>images/</code> directory.</li>
<li><code>Output/</code>, initially this directory is empty, but eventually it will contain the published book.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="writing-the-book">1.3 Writing the book</h2>

<p>Book contents are written in regular text archives using Markdown syntax. This format has become the <em>de facto</em> standard for writing documentation for Internet. If you are not familiar with Markdown syntax, read the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">official Markdown syntax reference</a>. Markdown is the only format currently supported by <strong>easybook</strong>. In the future, many more formats will be incorporated, such as reStructuredText, Textile and other widely used formats.</p>

<p>Therefore, forget <strong>easybook</strong> for a while and write the contents of your book in Markdown syntax using your favorite text editor (<code>vi</code>, <em>Notepad</em>, <em>TextMate</em>, <em>SublimeText</em>, etc.)</p>

<p>The structure of a book can be very complex (cover, title page, acknowledgements, dedication, chapters, parts, etc.). <strong>easybook</strong> supports all the common book content types, but for now, we'll just focus on the chapters. You can add as many chapters as you want and each one can be as large or as short as you need. All you have to do is to define the book chapters under the <code>contents</code> option of the <code>config.yml</code> file:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">book:
    ...
    contents:
        - { element: cover }
        - { element: toc   }
        - { element: chapter, number: 1, content: chapter1.md }
        - { element: chapter, number: 2, content: chapter2.md }</pre>
</div>

<p>Each line under the <code>contents</code> option defines a content of the book. The <code>cover</code> and <code>toc</code> lines are special contents that will be explained later. Add your book chapters with the  <code>chapter</code> type element. A chapter must set its number (with the <code>number</code> option) and the name of the file that holds its contents (with the <code>content</code> option).</p>

<p>Besides being lightning-fast, the main feature of <strong>easybook</strong> is its flexibility, as it never forces you to work in a certain way. Do you want to number your chapters in an <em>imaginative</em> way? People will think you're crazy, but <strong>easybook</strong> allows you to do it:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">book:
    ...
    contents:
        - { element: cover }
        - { element: toc   }
        - { element: chapter, number: 100, content: chapter1.md }
        - { element: chapter, number: 56,  content: chapter2.md }</pre>
</div>

<p>Do you need letters instead of numbers? This is usual for appendices instead of chapters, but <strong>easybook</strong> won't stop you from doing it:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">book:
    ...
    contents:
        - { element: cover }
        - { element: toc   }
        - { element: chapter, number: A, content: chapter1.md }
        - { element: chapter, number: B, content: chapter2.md }</pre>
</div>

<p>You can also use any name for the chapter contents file, as in the following example that mixes English and Spanish:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">book:
    ...
    contents:
        - { element: cover }
        - { element: toc   }
        - { element: chapter, number: 1, content: chapter1.md }
        - { element: chapter, number: 2, content: capitulo2.md }</pre>
</div>

<p>Using significant names for the book content files can easy its management:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">book:
    ...
    contents:
        - { element: cover }
        - { element: toc   }
        - { element: chapter, number: 1, content: publishing-your-first-book.md }
        - { element: chapter, number: 2, content: publishing-your-second-book.md }</pre>
</div>

<p>The most important thing about the <code>contents</code> option is the order in which you define the contents. The published book will be always composed of those contents and in that order. Therefore, the following configuration will output a book with  the cover between the two chapters and the table of contents at the very end (completely crazy, but really easy to do with <strong>easybook</strong>):</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">book:
    ...
    contents:
        - { element: chapter, number: 1, content: publishing-your-first-book.md }
        - { element: cover }
        - { element: chapter, number: 2, content: publishing-your-second-book.md }
        - { element: toc   }</pre>
</div>

<p>By default, all content archives are stored in the <code>Contents/</code> directory. However, if your book is complex, you can divide the contents into subdirectories. Then, include the name of all the subdirectories in the <code>content</code> option  (don't forget to enclose it with quotes if the file path has spaces):</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">book:
    ...
    contents:
        - { element: cover }
        - { element: toc   }
        - { element: chapter, number: 1, content: introduction/chapter1.md }
        - { element: chapter, number: 2, content: introduction/chapter2.md }
        - { element: chapter, number: 3, content: advanced/chapter1.md }</pre>
</div>

<p>The above configuration means that your book contents are distributed this way:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">&lt;book_dir&gt;/
    ...
    Contents/
        introduction/
            chapter1.md
            chapter2.md
        advanced/
            chapter1.md</pre>
</div>

<h2 id="publishing-the-book">1.4 Publishing the book</h2>

<p>When you finish writing all the chapters and after adding them to the <code>config.yml</code> archive, run the following command to publish the book (replace <code>the-origin-of-the-species</code> by the name of your book directory):</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">$ ./book publish 'the-origin-of-species' web</pre>
</div>

<p>If everything works fine, you should see a new <code>web</code> directory inside <code>Output/</code> directory. Enter the <code>web/</code> directory and you'll find a file named <code>book.html</code>. This is the complete book in HTML format, ready to publish it on the Internet.</p>

<p>Then, run the following command:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">$ ./book publish 'the-origin-of-species' website</pre>
</div>

<p>Now, inside <code>Output/</code> directory you'll find a new <code>website</code> directory with several HTML pages. Open <code>index.html</code> in your browser and you'll see that <strong>easybook</strong> has published your book as a fully-functional static website.</p>

<p>Lastly, run the following command:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">$ ./book publish 'the-origin-of-species' print</pre>
</div>

<p>Inside <code>Output/</code> directory you'll find a new <code>print</code> directory which contains a file name <code>book.pdf</code>. Open the file with your PDF reader and you'll see your book as a beautiful and carefully created PDF ebook. The PDF conversion is made with an external application named <a href="http://www.princexml.com/">PrinceXML</a>. If you don't have it installed on your computer, you can download a fully-functional demo version at <a href="http://www.princexml.com/download/">http://www.princexml.com/download/</a></p>

<p><strong>easybook</strong> lets you easily publish the same book in very different ways. Each of these <em>ways</em>  is called <strong>edition</strong>. This concept will be explained in the next chapter.</p>

<h2 id="book-configuration-options">1.5 Book configuration options</h2>

<p>In the previous sections we've mentioned the <code>author</code> configuration option. In fact, <strong>easybook</strong> books can set many more options in the <code>config.yml</code>file. The defaut values of the options are as follows:</p>

<div class="code code">
<pre class="code">book:
    title:            &quot;(the title typed when creating the book)&quot;
    author:           &quot;Change this: Author Name&quot;
    edition:          &quot;First edition&quot;
    language:         en
    publication_date: ~
&nbsp;
    generator: { name: easybook, version: 4.0 }
&nbsp;
    contents:
        # available element types: acknowledgement, appendix, author, chapter,
        # cover, dedication, edition, license, part, title, toc
        - { element: cover }
        - { element: toc   }
        - { element: chapter, number: 1, content: chapter1.md }
        - { element: chapter, number: 2, content: chapter2.md }
&nbsp;
    editions:
        print:
            # (this is a complex option, we'll see it later)
        web:
            # (this is a complex option, we'll see it later)
        website:
            # (this is a complex option, we'll see it later)</pre>
</div>

<p>The last two options are complex and are explained in detail in the following chapters: <code>contents</code> defines the book contents and their order; <code>editions</code> defines the features of each edition of the book.</p>

<p>The other options set the basic information of the book:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>title</code>, is the title of the book. By default <strong>easybook</strong> uses the title that you typed when creating the book, but you can change it if needed.</li>
<li><code>author</code>, is the name of the book author. If the book has multiple authors, write them all in a row separated by commas: <code>"Name1 Surname1, Name2 Surname2, ..."</code></li>
<li><code>edition</code>, is the text describing the edition of the book. Normally, you should use <em>first edition</em>, <em>second edition</em> and so on, but you can describe your book current edition in any way.</li>
<li><code>language</code>, the language of the book contents set with a two letter code: <code>en</code> for English, <code>es</code> for Spanish, <code>fr</code> for French, <code>it</code> for Italian, <code>de</code> for Deutsch, etc.</li>
<li><code>publication_date</code>,  the date of publication of the book. The default value is <code>~</code>, meaning no publication date. In this case, <strong>easybook</strong> will automatically set the date to the day on which the book is published. If you set a date, enter it in the <code>month-day-year</code> format. for example: <code>11-23-2012</code>.</li>
</ul>
