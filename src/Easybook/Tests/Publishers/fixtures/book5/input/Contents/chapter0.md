# Mobile features

This page shows the new features of the **mobile** edition and **Mobile** theme.

* **JQuery Mobile user interface.**

  Headers and footers are formatted with JQuery Mobile UI elements, including links to next/previous
  chapters.
  
* **Retractable Table Of Contents.**

  To save screen space and improve usability, a retractable TOC is available as a navigation menu. It
  can be shown and hidden by clicking the relevant header button.       

* **Clickable links with tooltips.**
 
  Words found in definition lists are automatically transformed into clickable links in the page. 
  Clicking on them will show a balloon with the description for that term.   
  Example:
   
      > **easybook** is an application that lets you easily publish books in various electronic formats. 
      Originally it was designed to publish technical programming books, but you can use **easyboook** 
      to publish any kind of book, manual or documentation.
      
      >This paragraph contains the test words: entity, entities, book, books, publish.
