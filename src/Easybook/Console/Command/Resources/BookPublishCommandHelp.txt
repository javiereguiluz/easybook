The <info>publish</info> command publishes an edition of a book.

If you don't include any parameter, the command will guide you through an
interactive publisher. You can bypass the interactive publisher typing 
the name of the edition after the <info>publish</info> command:

<info>$ ./book publish website</info>

By default, <comment>easybook</comment> looks for the book contents in the
<info>current working directory</info> directory.
If your book is in another directory, use the <info>--dir</info> option:

<info>$ ./book publish print --dir=../any/other/directory</info>

The value of <info>--dir</info> option is considered as the parent directory of
the book directory. In the previous example, the book must be in the
following directory:

any/
  other/
    directory/
      the-origin-of-species/
          config.yml
          Contents/
              chapter1.md
              chapter2.md

Book configuration is defined in <info>config.yml</info> file, but you can set
new options or override configured values with <info>--configuration</info>
option:

<info>$ ./book publish print --configuration='{ "book": { "title": "...", "author": "...", "new-option": "..." } }'</info>

The value of <info>--configuration</info> option must be a JSON formatted string.
