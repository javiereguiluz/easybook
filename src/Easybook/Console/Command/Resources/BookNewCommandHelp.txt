The <info>new</info> command generates the file and directory structure
required by <comment>easybook</comment> books.

If you don't include any parameter, the command will guide you through
an interactive generator. You can bypass the interactive generator typing
the title of the book after the <info>new</info> command (enclose the title with quotes):

<info>$ ./book new "The Origin of Species"</info>

By default, <comment>easybook</comment> uses the <info>current working directory/</info> 
to save the book contents. If you want to save them in any other directory, use the <info>--dir</info> option:

<info>$ ./book new --dir=../any/other/directory</info>

The value of <info>--dir</info> option is considered as the parent directory of
the book directory. In the previous example, the book will be created in the 
following directory:

any/
  other/
    directory/
      {book-slug}/
          config.yml
          Contents/
              chapter1.md
              chapter2.md

You can type the title and use the <info>--dir</info> option simultaneously:

<info>$ ./book new "The Origin of Species" --dir=../any/other/directory</info>
