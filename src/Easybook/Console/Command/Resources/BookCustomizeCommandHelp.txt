The <info>customize</info> command eases the customization of the book design.

This command generates the needed CSS stylesheet to customize the design of the
given edition of the book. You can use this stylesheet as a guide to generate
the final CSS applied to your edition.

If you don't include any parameter, the command will guide you through an
interactive publisher. You can bypass the interactive publisher typing the
slug of the book and the name of the edition after the <info>customize</info> command:

<info>$ ./book customize the-origin-of-species print</info>

By default, <comment>easybook</comment> looks for the book contents in its <info>doc/</info> directory.
If your book is in another directory, use the <info>--dir</info> option:

<info>$ ./book customize the-origin-of-species print --dir=../any/other/directory</info>

The value of <info>--dir</info> option is considered as the parent directory of
the book directory. In the previous example, the book must be in the
following directory:

any/
  other/
    directory/
      the-origin-of-species/
          config.yml
          Contents/
              chapter1.md
              chapter2.md
